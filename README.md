# UNSWifties website

This is the repository which hosts the UNSWifties website source code - which is programmed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) and hosted on GitHub pages. If you wish to contribute to the repository, please contact the [IT Director](mailto:will.kennedy@student.unsw.edu.au) to request contributor permissions and read the workflow processes in our Wiki.
